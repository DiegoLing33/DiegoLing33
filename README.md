1️⃣ The important project of mine is [KIPFIN](https://github.com/DiegoLing33/kipfin). It's the application for Financial Univercity. It contains admission tools and profiles for the entrants. I reached the commendation for this project from the rector of the univercity. Application is here - http://kipfin.ru , but it contains the auth system, it means that if U wanna try - U should to sign in.

2️⃣ The best project (as for me) I ever developed is [WoW Guild Web Application](https://github.com/DiegoLing33/wow-guild-webapp). It's not offical, not for my work, but it contains the example of my code - comments, structuring and etc. Moreover, this project contains a lot of interesting snippets developed by my own. U can try it: http://prestij.xyz (*It's my own wow guild*)

#### Back-end development

Yes, as I said I work with the back-end too. But I really dont want to publish my back-end projects, cuz its not good enough. I always had to write back-end, cuz I'm always develop everything with the best team - with my one. It will be like a grace if one day I will be able to write the front-end application with no back-end.
